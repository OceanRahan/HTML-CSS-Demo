    <p><h2> 5 Strange Behavior of Cats</h2><p>
      <p> Cats are mysterious creatures, and nearly every owner has been puzzled by their feline behavior. Here is a list of
        13 strange behavior shown by cats:
        <ol>
          <li>Chattering</li>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md">
              <p>You have probably heard your cat emit a fast and intense teeth chattering- especially when they spot a bird while gazing out of a window.
                Behaviorists speculate that this is because your cat is frustrated that they cannot get outside to hunt prey. They also may be excited and
                slightly aggravated.Others say that this strange jaw movement may be your kitty’s natural instinct that allows their muscles to prepare for
                the act of killing prey. Either way, this behavior is completely normal for your feline. Here is a cute video of chattering cats:

            <div class="col-md">
              <p>When your kitty rubs his head on you, he is doing more than just showing you affection and saying hello. He is actually doing something that
                behaviorist’s call “bunting”. Pheromones are actually being released from his head and it is his way of showing ownership over you. Just as a cat
                would rub on furniture to leave his scent to mark his territory- he is showing pride in that you are his.

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md">
              <p>Behaviorists have a few theories on why your cat is persistent in his pursuit of leaving you “gifts”. Even though this habit may be perceived as a
                gross one- your kitty is acknowledging you as a member of his group, and is sharing his hunting success with you. He could be thanking you for taking
                care of him or perhaps you pay more attention to him when he generously brings you rodents, birds, or insects.
                If this is a behavior you would like to curb of your outdoor cat, try putting a bell on his collar so that it is more challenging to hunt.

                When your cat presses his paws into you, and massages back and forth- this can be a rather enjoyable feline behavior. Your kitty’s instinct
                to do this traces back to their earliest days of nursing. By pressing his paws on his mother’s mammary glands, it encouraged better milk production.
                When your cat does this as an adult he is either content, and showing that he is happy, or he is trying to alleviate stress and the habit is one to calm him down.
                Either way, take it as a compliment that you remind him of his mommy!

              <p>
                Books, newspapers or computer keyboards — you name it and your cat has probably laid on it while you’re using it. Not only does kitty want to be near you,
                as he knows that you will give him the loving attention that he desires, he also likes to feel secure. When you’re doing something that makes you relax, being
                near you will make him relax as well. Plus, just maybe, you’ll remember his smell and want to be near him again.
