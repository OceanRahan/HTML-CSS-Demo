        <h2>Kitten Care: Must-know tips for raising a cat </h2>
        <p>
         When it comes to raising kittens, the philosophy is pretty similar to that of bringing up children.
         If you provide proper care and training when they’re young, it increases the odds they’ll grow up to be healthy,
         well-adjusted adults. So if you recently adopted a kitten, start incorporating this advice as soon as possible.

    <li>Don’t Treat Your Kitten Like an Adult Cat</li>
      <p>
        Just as a human infant has vastly different needs than a teenager, a kitten will have care requirements distinct from those
        of a fully matured cat. In addition, you should consider a kitten’s various stages of development when caring for her.

    <li>Reward Good Behavior and Socialize, Socialize, Socialize</li>
    <p>
      The socialization and training your cat receives during kittenhood will affect how well she will likely interact with people and other animals when she’s older.
      “I remember the first time I fostered kittens and how worried I was about scaring them,” says Jane Harrell. “What I didn’t know was that that was a critical socialization
      period for them and not exposing them to things made them more nervous as adults. Now when I foster kittens I do everything I can to get them exposed to as much as possible – loud noises,
      walking on leashes, strangers, you name it! It all helps them become better-adjusted, healthy adult cats.” Just makre sure your kittens have a positive experience out of any socialization exposure you provide them.
    </p>

    <li>Make Preventive Care a Priority</li>
    <p>
      No matter what, schedule your kitten’s first vet appointment within a week of getting her. Early and frequent vet visits will help socialize your kitten
      with the vet and help the vet establish a baseline for your kitten’s health.
      <br></br>
      Have a veterinarian check your kitten for worms and intestinal parasites, and have her de-wormed, if necessary. And while heartworms aren’t as much of a problem for cats as they are for dogs, some kittens may be susceptible,
      so also ask your vet if he or she recommends a heartworm preventative. The biggest parasitic threat to your kitten, however, is fleas. You can start administering topical flea preventatives when your kitten is around 8 to 12
      weeks of age — although some brands are formulated for kittens as young as 4 weeks old.

       Preventive care for kittens may include vaccines for feline leukemia, rabies and distemper. These shots are usually first administered when a kitten is around 8 weeks of age, with boosters given every few weeks until she reaches
       16 weeks of age. After that, your veterinarian can set her up on an adult vaccination schedule. He or she may also recommend additional vaccinations.
