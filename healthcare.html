        <h2> General Cat Care</h2>
        <p>
          Have you recently added a feline friend to your family? Congratulations! We know you’ll be thrilled to have your new cat in your home.
          If you are considering adopting a cat, please visit your local shelter. We encourage you to browse our directory of adoptable cats in
          your area, or use our shelter finder to start your search.
          Read on for useful tips for new cat parents, and for those looking to brush up on their pet care skills.

      <li>Feeding</li>
      <p>
        We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food. Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and
        determine the best diet. Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat.

        <p class="para"> Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten.
          Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.</p>
        <p class="para">You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat’s water bowls daily.</p>
        <p class="para"> Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.</p>
        <p class="para">Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well  Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic
        powder, your pet could be poisoned.</p>
        <p class="para">Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.</p>

    <li> Grooming </li>
    <p>
      Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or comb your cat regularly. Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean,
      reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.

  <li> Housing </li>
  <p>
    Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest. Line your cat's bed with a soft, warm blanket or towel. Be sure to wash the bedding often. Please keep your cat indoors. Outdoor cats do not live as long as indoor cats.
    Outdoor cats are at risk of trauma from cars, or from fights with other cats, raccoons and free-roaming dogs. Coyotes are known to eat cats. Outdoor cats are more likely to become infested with fleas or ticks, as well as contract infectious diseases.

<li> Indentification </li>
<p>
  If allowed outdoors, your cat must wear a safety collar and an ID tag. A safety collar with an elastic panel will allow your cat to break loose if the collar gets caught on something. And for both indoor and outdoor cats, an ID tag or an implanted microchip can help ensure that your cat is
  returned if he or she becomes lost.
</p>
<li> Scratching </li>
<p>
Cats need to scratch! When a cat scratches, the old outer nail sheath is pulled off and the sharp, smooth claws underneath are exposed. Cutting your cat’s nails every two to three weeks will keep them relatively blunt and less likely to harm the arms of both humans and furniture. Provide your cat with a sturdy scratching post,
at least three feet high. The post should also be stable enough that it won't wobble during use, and should be covered with rough material such as sisal, burlap or tree bark. Many cats also like scratching pads.

<ul>
  <li> Health Care</li>
  <p>
    Your cat should see the veterinarian at least once a year for an examination and annual shots, and immediately if she is sick or injured.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Medicines & poisons </li>
      <p>Never give your cat medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian </p>
      <li> Spaying and Neutering</li>
      <p>Female cats should be spayed and male cats neutered by five months of age.</p>
      <li>Vaccinations</li>
      <p>Your veterinarian will make recommendations based on your cat's age and health.</p>
