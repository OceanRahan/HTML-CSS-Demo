      The Norwegian Forest Cat is a gentle giant. They’re large and athletic, so you may find them sitting atop the highest point in your home,
      and they have no qualms about jumping down. Norwegian Forest Cats are fond of their family but are reserved with visitors.
      <br></br>As a laid-back and independent breed, they don’t demand constant attention. Norwegian Forest Cats are content to simply sit in the same room
      with their humans and will happily entertain themselves while alone. These felines are moderately active, enjoying spurts of activity followed
      by long cat naps, and are happy to play in water. They get along with other dogs and cats, as well as mild-mannered children.

      This docile house cat has what some would call a rambunctious personality. Bengal cats are playful
      and love to chase, climb, investigate and be part of the action. They seek out a lot of attention,
      are always on the move and can easily get into mischief around your home.
      <br></br>
      Most Bengal Cats are up for adventure and can even be trained to walk on a leash to safely explore the outdoors.
      She’s intelligent, curious and may splash in a fish tank or even hop in the shower with you.
